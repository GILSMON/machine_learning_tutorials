Title: Machine Learning Model for Predicting Olympic Medal Count

Description:

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts the number of medals a country will win at the Olympics based on features such as the number of athletes, previous medals won, and age. The model utilizes a linear regression approach and is trained on historical data.

Key Features:

Predicts Olympic medal count for countries based on historical data.
Employs linear regression for modeling the relationship between features and medal count.
Provides functionalities to:
Explore the data through visualizations (correlation matrix, scatter plots, histograms).
Preprocess data by handling missing values and splitting into training and testing sets.
Evaluate model performance using mean absolute error (MAE).
Analyze error distribution and error ratio by team.
Installation:

Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/machine-learning-tutorials.git
Create a virtual environment (recommended): python -m venv venv
Activate the environment:
Linux/macOS: source venv/bin/activate
Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage:

Run the script: python olympic_model.py (replace with your actual script name)
The script will perform data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, evaluation, and analysis.
The results, including visualizations and error metrics, will be displayed.
Dependencies:

pandas
seaborn
scikit-learn
numpy
Model Performance:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on testing set: (replace with actual MAE value)
Future Considerations:

Explore alternative machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests).
Incorporate additional features (e.g., sports played, GDP).
Handle imbalanced data, if present.
Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
