# Machine Learning Model for Predicting Olympic Medal Count

**Description:**

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model that predicts the number of medals a country will win at the Olympics based on features such as the number of athletes, previous medals won, and age. The model utilizes a linear regression approach and is trained on historical data.

**Key Features:**

- Predicts Olympic medal count for countries based on historical data.
- Employs linear regression for modeling the relationship between features and medal count.
- Provides functionalities to:
    - Explore the data through visualizations (correlation matrix, scatter plots, histograms).
    - Preprocess data by handling missing values and splitting into training and testing sets.
    - Evaluate model performance using mean absolute error (MAE).
    - Analyze error distribution and error ratio by team.

**Dependencies:**

-pandas
-seaborn
-scikit-learn
-numpy

**Model Performance:**

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on testing set: **3.2987654320987656**

**Future Considerations:**

- Explore alternative machine learning models (e.g., decision trees, random forests).
- Incorporate additional features (e.g., sports played, GDP).
- Handle imbalanced data, if present.
- Experiment with hyperparameter tuning for better performance.
