# Improving Data Quality with Pandas

This repository contains a Google Colab notebook that demonstrates various techniques for improving data quality using Pandas. The notebook focuses on resolving common data issues like missing values, inconsistent data types, and categorical features.

## Notebook Overview

The notebook covers the following data quality improvement tasks:

1. **Resolving Missing Values:** Filling in missing values using appropriate strategies (e.g., using the mean for numerical features, mode for categorical features).
2. **Converting Data Types:** Converting columns to the correct data types (e.g., converting the 'Date' column to datetime format).
3. **Renaming and Cleaning Columns:** Renaming columns for consistency and removing unwanted characters or values.
4. **Handling Categorical Features:** Applying one-hot encoding to transform categorical features into numerical vectors that machine learning models can understand.
5. **Temporal Feature Conversions:** Converting temporal features (like year, month, day) into meaningful representations for analysis.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
Use code with caution
bash git clone [redacted link]

 
2. **Open the notebook:** Open the `improve_data_quality.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.
3. **Run the code:** Execute the code cells in the notebook to see the data quality improvement steps in action.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this notebook is based on California's Vehicle Fuel Type Count by Zip Code report. It has been modified to introduce data quality issues for learning purposes.
